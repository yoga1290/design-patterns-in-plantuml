# Introduction

My aim of creating this is to have a cheat sheet of Design Patterns, as well as a handy snippets of PlantUML diagrams that can be edited and generated in-browser; online playground.

Some code snippets were pulled from [Pladitor blog](https://plantumleditor.com/blog) with minor edits/refactors, some were coded from scratch and some examples were added from [Refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).

# How to open/run:

+ [Open in preview mode here](notebook.ipynb)
+ Run interactively inside Docker container
    + Pull repo and run `docker compose up`
    + Open through proper URL on browser
+ Run interactively online through Google CoLab:    <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/yoga1290/design-patterns-in-plantuml/blob/main/colab_compatible.ipynb">
